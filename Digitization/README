1. Combine cells in the ECAL
    quick use: just source combine.sh, and parameters in it are quite clear. This script will be also further modified for submitting jobs to the batch system.
    combine_cells.py: the script run by combine.sh, which will combine cells in the ECAL.
    combine_cells.ipynb: the notebook version of combine_cells.py, mainly for debugging and testing, doesnt guarantee the exact same as combine_cells.py.
